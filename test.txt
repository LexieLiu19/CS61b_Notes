Java has certain built-in Abstract data types that you can use. These are packaged in Java Libraries.

The three most important ADTs come in the java.util library:

List: an ordered collection of items
A popular implementation is the ArrayList
Set: an unordered collection of strictly unique items (no repeats)
A popular implementation is the HashSet
Map: a collection of key/value pairs. You access the value via the key.
A popular implementation is the HashMap
